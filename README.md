Share redux state across the network between multiple clients and server!

_This package is experimental and API will change._

Here is the client lib that you cand use in your browser-based or node-based project.
Only works if your browser supports webSockets.


Please consult the [server](https://github.com/baptistemanson/redux-share-server) for the full documentation.
